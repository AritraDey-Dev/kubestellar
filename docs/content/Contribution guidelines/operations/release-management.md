### Publishing a new KubeStellar release

#### Prerequisite - make sure you have a GPG signing key

1. [https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key)

### Create the tags

#### Note:
You currently need write access to the [{{ config.repo_url }}]({{ config.repo_url }}) repository to perform these tasks.

<!-- You also need an available team member with approval permissions from [https://github.com/openshift/release/blob/master/ci-operator/config/{{ config.repo_short_name }}/OWNERS](https://github.com/openshift/release/blob/master/ci-operator/config/{{ config.repo_short_name }}/OWNERS). -->

### Checkout the main branch
```shell
git clone git@github.com:{{ config.repo_short_name }}.git
cd {{ config.repo_default_file_path }}
git checkout main
```

### Update the 'kubectl-kubestellar-prep_for_syncer' file with a reference to the new version of the kubestellar syncer version
```shell
vi outer-scripts/kubectl-kubestellar-prep_for_syncer
```

change the version in the following line:
```shell
syncer_image="quay.io/kubestellar/syncer:{{ config.ks_next_tag }}"
```

### Update the core-helm-chart 'Chart.yaml' and 'values.yaml' files with a reference to the new version of the KubeStellar Helm chart version
```shell
vi core-helm-chart/Chart.yaml
```

change the versions in the following line:
```shell
version: {{ config.ks_next_helm_version }}
appVersion: {{ config.ks_next_tag }}
```

```shell
vi core-helm-chart/values.yaml
```

change the version in the following line:
```shell
tag: {{ config.ks_next_branch }}
```

### Update the VERSION file
The VERSION file points to the 'latest' and 'stable' release tags associated with the most recent release (latest) and the most stable release (stable).  Update the 'stable' and 'latest tags accordingly

```shell
vi VERSION
```

<b>before:</b>
```shell title="VERSION" hl_lines="2 3"
...
stable={{ config.ks_tag }}
latest={{ config.ks_tag }}
...
```

<b>after:</b>
```shell title="VERSION" hl_lines="2 3" 
...
stable={{ config.ks_tag }}
latest={{ config.ks_next_tag }}
...
```

### Push the main branch
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "updates to main to support new release"
git push -u origin main
```

### Create a release-major.minor branch
To create a release branch, identify the current 'release' branches' name (e.g. {{ config.ks_next_branch }}).  Increment the <major> or <minor> segment as part of the 'release' branches' name.  For instance, the 'release' branch is '{{ config.ks_branch }}', you might name the new release branch '{{ config.ks_next_branch }}'.
```shell
git checkout -b {{ config.ks_next_branch }}
```

### Update the mkdocs.yml file
The mkdocs.yml file points to the branch and tag associated with the branch you have checked out.  Update the ks_branch and ks_tag key/value pairs at the top of the file

```shell
vi docs/mkdocs.yml
```

<b>before:</b>
```shell title="mkdocs.yml" hl_lines="2 3 4 5 6 7 8"
...
edit_uri: edit/main/docs/content
ks_branch: 'main'
ks_tag: '{{ config.ks_tag }}'
ks_current_helm_version: {{ config.ks_current_helm_version }}
ks_next_branch: '{{ config.ks_next_branch }}'
ks_next_tag: '{{ config.ks_next_tag }}'
ks_next_helm_version: {{ config.ks_next_helm_version }}
...
```

<b>after:</b>
```shell title="mkdocs.yml" hl_lines="2 3 4 5 6 7 8" 
...
edit_uri: edit/{{ config.ks_next_branch }}/docs/content
ks_branch: '{{ config.ks_next_branch }}'
ks_tag: '{{ config.ks_next_tag }}'
ks_current_helm_version: {{ config.ks_next_helm_version }}
ks_next_branch:    # put the branch name of the next numerical branch that will come in the future
ks_next_tag:       # put the tag name of the next numerical tag that will come in the future
ks_next_helm_version: # put the number of the next logical helm version
...
```

### Remove the current 'stable' alias using 'mike' (DANGER!)
Be careful, this will cause links to the 'stable' docs, which is the default for our community, to become unavailable.  For now, point 'stable' at 'main'
```shell
cd docs
mike delete stable # remove the 'stable' alias from the current '{{ config.ks_branch }}' branches' doc set
mike deploy --push --rebase --update-aliases main stable # this generates the 'main' branches' docs set and points 'stable' at it temporarily
cd ..
```


### Push the new release branch
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "new release version {{ config.ks_next_branch }}"
git push -u origin {{ config.ks_next_branch }} # replace <major>.<minor> with your incremented <major>.<minor> pair
```

### Update the 'stable' alias using 'mike'
```shell
cd docs
mike delete stable # remove the 'stable' alias from the 'main' branches' doc set
git pull
mike deploy --push --rebase --update-aliases {{ config.ks_next_branch }} stable  # this generates the new '{{ config.ks_next_branch }}' branches' doc set and points 'stable' at it
cd ..
```

### Test your doc site
Open a Chrome Incognito browser to [{{ config.docs_url }}]({{ config.docs_url }}) and look for the version drop down to be updated to the new release you just pushed with 'git' and deployed with 'mike'

### Create a tagged release
View the existing tags you have for the repo

```shell
git fetch --tags
git tag
```

create a tag that follows <major>.<minor>.<patch>.  For this example we will increment tag '{{ config.ks_tag }}' to '{{ config.ks_next_tag }}'

```shell
TAG={{ config.ks_next_tag }}
REF={{ config.ks_next_branch }}
git tag --sign --message "$TAG" "$TAG" "$REF"
git push origin --tags
```

### Create a build
```shell
./hack/make-release-full.sh {{ config.ks_next_tag }}
```

### Update the kubestellar container image just build and uploaded to quay.io

Head up to quay.io and look for the image of KubeStellar container just uploaded.
Make this image 'stable' so that helm and other install methods pickup this image.

### Create a release in GH UI
- Navigate to the KubeStellar GitHub Source Repository Releases section at {{ config.repo_url }}/releases
- Click 'Draft a new release' and select the tag ('{{ config.ks_next_tag }}')
    - Select the release branch you created above ({{ config.ks_next_branch }})
    - Add a release title ({{ config.ks_next_tag }})
    - Add some release notes ('generate release notes' if you like)
    - select 'pre-release' as a the first step.  Once validated the release is working properly, come back and mark as 'release'
    - Attach the binaries that were created in the 'make-release-full' process above
        - You add the KubeStellar-specific '*.tar.gz' and the 'checksum256.txt' files
        - GitHub will automatically add the 'Source Code (zip)' and 'Source Code (tar.gz)'

### Check that GH Workflows for docs are working
Check to make sure the GitHub workflows for doc generation, doc push, and broken links is working and passing
[{{ config.repo_url }}/actions/workflows/docs-gen-and-push.yml]({{ config.repo_url }}/actions/workflows/docs-gen-and-push.yml)
[{{ config.repo_url }}/actions/workflows/broken-links-crawler.yml]({{ config.repo_url }}/actions/workflows/broken-links-crawler.yml)

If the release notes have been pre-populated, delete them.
For the "previous tag," select the most recent, appropriate tag as the starting point
If this is a new minor release (e.g. v0.8.0), select the initial version of the previous minor release (e.g. v0.7.0)
If this is a patch release (e.g. v0.8.7), select the previous patch release (e.g. v0.8.6)
