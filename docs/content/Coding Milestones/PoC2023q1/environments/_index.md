There will be 2 environments designed, created, and maintained for KubeStellar:</br></br>
- A cloud environment (cloud-env) which will be used to deploy, scale, and measure metrics associated with small, medium, and large-scale KubeStellar experiments,</br></br>
- A development environment (dev-env) which will be used to deploy a small local KubeStellar installation that is sized for daily use and experimentation on a laptop.</br>
